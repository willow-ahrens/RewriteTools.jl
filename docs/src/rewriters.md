## Composing Rewriters with Updated Approach

Rewriters are powerful tools for transforming expressions. They can be composed and chained together to create sophisticated transformations.

### Overview of Composing Rewriters

A rewriter is any callable object that takes an expression and returns either a new expression or `nothing`. `Nothing` indicates no applicable changes. The `RewriteTools.Rewriters` module provides several types of rewriters:

- `Empty()`: Always returns `nothing`.
- `Chain(itr)`: Chains an iterator of rewriters into a single rewriter. Each rewriter is applied in sequence. If a rewriter returns `nothing`, it's treated as a no-change.
- `RestartedChain(itr)`: Similar to `Chain(itr)` but restarts from the first rewriter after a successful application.
- `IfElse(cond, rw1, rw2)`: Applies `rw1` if `cond` returns true, otherwise `rw2`.
- `If(cond, rw)`: Equivalent to `IfElse(cond, rw, Empty())`.
- `Prewalk(rw; threaded=false, thread_cutoff=100)`: Performs a pre-order traversal of an expression, applying `rw` at each step. `threaded` enables multithreading.
- `Postwalk(rw; threaded=false, thread_cutoff=100)`: Post-order traversal, applying `rw`.
- `Fixpoint(rw)`: Repeatedly applies `rw` until no further changes occur.
- `PassThrough(rw)`: If `rw(x)` returns `nothing`, `PassThrough` returns `x` instead.

### Chaining Rewriters

Rewriters can be combined into a chain, allowing multiple rules to be applied sequentially:

```julia:composing1
using RewriteTools
using RewriteTools.Rewriters

sqexpand = @rule :call(^, :call(+, ~x, ~y), 2) => :((($x)^2 + ($y)^2 + 2 * $x * $y))
pyid = @rule :call(+, :call(^, :call(sin, ~x), 2), :call(^, :call(cos, ~x), 2)) => 1

csa = Chain([sqexpand, pyid])
csa(:(sin(x) + cos(x))^2)
```

An important feature of `Chain` is that it returns the transformed expression instead of `nothing` if there are no changes:

```julia:composing2
Chain([@rule :call(+, :call(^, :call(sin, ~x), 2), :call(^, :call(cos, ~x), 2)) => 1])(:(sin(x) + cos(x))^2)
```

The order of rules in a chain matters:

```julia:composing3
cas = Chain([pyid, sqexpand])
cas(:(sin(x) + cos(x))^2)
```

In this case, applying the Pythagorean identity before expanding the square prevents the matching of squares of sine and cosine.

`RestartedChain` addresses the order issue by restarting the chain after each successful rule application:

```julia:composing4
rcas = RestartedChain([pyid, sqexpand])
rcas(:(sin(x) + cos(x))^2)
```

For continuous application of rules until no more changes are made, `Fixpoint` is used:

```julia:composing5
Fixpoint(cas)(:(sin(x) + cos(x))^2)
```
