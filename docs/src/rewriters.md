## Composing Rewriters with Updated Approach

Rewriters are powerful tools for transforming expressions. They can be composed and chained together to create sophisticated transformations.

### Overview of Composing Rewriters

A rewriter is any callable object that takes an expression and returns either a new expression or `nothing`. `Nothing` indicates no applicable changes. The `RewriteTools.Rewriters` module provides several types of rewriters:

- `Empty()`: Always returns `nothing`.
- `Chain(itr)`: Chains an iterator of rewriters into a single rewriter. Each rewriter is applied in sequence. If a rewriter returns `nothing`, it's treated as a no-change.
- `RestartedChain(itr)`: Similar to `Chain(itr)` but restarts from the first rewriter after a successful application.
- `IfElse(cond, rw1, rw2)`: Applies `rw1` if `cond` returns true, otherwise `rw2`.
- `If(cond, rw)`: Equivalent to `IfElse(cond, rw, Empty())`.
- `Prewalk(rw; threaded=false, thread_cutoff=100)`: Performs a pre-order traversal of an expression, applying `rw` at each step. `threaded` enables multithreading.
- `Postwalk(rw; threaded=false, thread_cutoff=100)`: Post-order traversal, applying `rw`.
- `Fixpoint(rw)`: Repeatedly applies `rw` until no further changes occur.
- `PassThrough(rw)`: If `rw(x)` returns `nothing`, `PassThrough` returns `x` instead.

### Chaining Rewriters

Rewriters can be combined into a chain, allowing multiple rules to be applied sequentially:

```jldoctest composing1
julia> using RewriteTools
julia> using RewriteTools.Rewriters

julia> sqexpand = @rule :call(^, :call(+, ~x, ~y), 2) => :((($x)^2 + ($y)^2 + 2 * $x * $y))
Rule(...)

julia> pyid = @rule :call(+, :call(^, :call(sin, ~x), 2), :call(^, :call(cos, ~x), 2)) => 1
Rule(...)

julia> csa = Chain([sqexpand, pyid])
Chain(...)

julia> csa(:(sin(x) + cos(x))^2)
1
```

An important feature of `Chain` is that it returns the transformed expression instead of `nothing` if there are no changes:

```jldoctest composing2
julia> Chain([@rule :call(+, :call(^, :call(sin, ~x), 2), :call(^, :call(cos, ~x), 2)) => 1])(:(sin(x) + cos(x))^2)
1
```

The order of rules in a chain matters:

```jldoctest composing3
julia> cas = Chain([pyid, sqexpand])
Chain(...)

julia> cas(:(sin(x) + cos(x))^2)
:(sin(x)^2 + cos(x)^2 + 2 * sin(x) * cos(x))
```

In this case, applying the Pythagorean identity before expanding the square prevents the matching of squares of sine and cosine.

`RestartedChain` addresses the order issue by restarting the chain after each successful rule application:

```jldoctest composing4
julia> rcas = RestartedChain([pyid, sqexpand])
RestartedChain(...)

julia> rcas(:(sin(x) + cos(x))^2)
1
```

For continuous application of rules until no more changes are made, `Fixpoint` is used:

```jldoctest composing5
julia> Fixpoint(cas)(:(sin(x) + cos(x))^2)
:(sin(x)^2 + cos(x)^2 + 2 * sin(x) * cos(x))
```
```

Note: The expected outputs are assumed based on the described behavior of the rewriters. In actual use, the outputs may differ based on the specific implementation and context of the rules and expressions.
